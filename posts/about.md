I am a ***Software Developer*** with over a decade experience in mobile and enterprise systems, from early discovery through production.

I approach engineering as ***craft***, valuing human authorship, collaboration and responsible AI-assisted workflows over black-box automation and proprietary lock-in. ***Open source***, ***inclusive design***, ***data privacy***, ***digital sovereignty***, and ***ecologically sustainable architecture*** are the principles that guide that practice.

With an ongoing interest in ***Critical Theory*** and ***Philosophy of Technology***, my goal is to build digital experiences and tools grounded in sound critical thinking: questioning assumptions, resisting convenience as justification for ethical compromise, and insisting on systems that respect the communities and ecologies that sustain us.

Model collapse is what happens when AI systems train on AI-generated data: outputs converge, variance flattens, and the system consumes its own tail distribution. As a social condition, what collapses in algorithmic monocultures is the irreducible particularity, creativity and contingency of lived existence: the dreams, contradictions, and opacities that refuse categorization and make our lives meaningful. Blind automation accelerates collapse by foreclosing human authorship. Keeping that authorship legible, accountable and celebrated is not merely a romantic gesture. It is a technical and ethical necessity.
