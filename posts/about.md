I am a ***Software Developer*** with over a decade experience in mobile and enterprise systems, from early discovery through production.

I approach engineering as ***craft***, valuing human authorship, collaboration and responsible AI-assisted workflows over black-box automation and proprietary lock-in. ***Open source***, ***inclusive design***, ***data privacy***, ***digital sovereignty***, and ***ecologically sustainable architecture*** are some of the principles that guide that practice.

With ongoing practice in ***Critical Theory*** and ***Philosophy of Technology***, my goal is to design and build digital experiences and tools grounded in sound critical thinking: questioning assumptions, resisting convenience as justification for ethically compromised solutions, and insisting on systems that respect the communities and ecologies that sustain us.

***Model collapse*** is what happens when AI systems train on AI-generated data: outputs converge, variance narrows, and the model consumes its own tail. As a social paradigm, what collapses in algorithmic monocultures is the irreducible particularity and contingency of lived existence: the dreams, contradictions, and opacities that make our lives vibrant and meaningful. Blind automation accelerates collapse by foreclosing human authorship. Keeping that authorship legible, accountable, and celebrated is not merely a romantic gesture. It is a technical and ethical necessity.
