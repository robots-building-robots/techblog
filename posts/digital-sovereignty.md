title: "Ditching Big Tech"

In January 2026, I made the resolution to ditch US-based **Big Tech** as much as possible. We are living through a time of intensifying geopolitical tension and accelerating consolidation of digital infrastructure into the hands of a small number of empire-scale corporations who surveil our activity, mine our content, and sell it back to us like bottled water — or more like high fructose slop. 

Most people don't care where their data lives. We choose what's cheap, familiar, and what works. The real costs of that convenience are never disclosed at the moment we signup. We have quietly normalized storing our digital lives under legal systems we never agreed to, in jurisdictions where we have no standing. That normalization is worth resisting.

This infrastructure isn't neutral. The same data pipelines and AI systems powering our productivity tools are procured for unlawful surveillance, policing, and warfare. The small print doesn't mention that. And none of it is more ethical for being algorithmic.

**Small Tech**, not anti-technology, is the framing here. Smaller, local alternatives that can actually be held accountable — not platforms that answer to no one.

For inspiration, I looked to Paris Marx's <a href="https://disconnect.blog/getting-off-us-tech-a-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Off US Tech</a>, Scott Galloway's <a href="https://www.resistandunsubscribe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resist and Unsubscribe</a>, and <a href="https://quitgpt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuitGPT</a>, but with a few different needs as a software developer focused open source tooling and the responsible use of AI, which, for better or worse, is now considered a professional baseline.

## Sovereignty Stack

### Infrastructure & Identity
**OS, Browser, Email, DNS:** The base layer everything else flows through. Get this wrong and nothing above it matters. Hardest to change, highest stakes.

### Professional Data
**Code repositories, CI/CD, Cloud Documents, Web hosting, LLMs:** Where the work lives: source code, client data, intellectual property, and the AI tools now inside the creative process. Stakes are professional and legal. Moderately difficult to migrate.

### Communications & Collaboration

**Messaging, Team Communications, Video calls, Calendar, Contacts:** High-frequency and often sensitive, but the risk is metadata and surveillance rather than long-term data custody. Easier to change.

### Convenience & Consumption

**Maps, Media streaming, Social Media, Search:** In some cases the highest friction to replace, but lowest sovereignty stakes.

## Migration Log

I've started where the cost and effort-to-impact ratio makes the most sense. Changing an email provider is manageable; replacing your OS without grinding your daily workload to a halt is a long-term goal for me. What follows is an ongoing log of where I started, where I'm moving, and why.

The "But I have nothing to hide" argument hasn't aged well. It assumes the rules won't change, the platforms won't be sold, and the data won't be misused. Data Privacy isn't about secrecy — it's about who holds power over your information and what they can do with it. Digital Sovereignty extends that question to jurisdiction: not just who holds the power, but under what law, with what accountability, and at what cost to community and the environment. For Canadians, there is a persistent gap between the privacy protections we assume we have and what is actually enforceable when a service runs on US infrastructure, regardless of where the physical servers actually sit. This isn't about national borders. It's about legibility.

Every time we sign up or sign in we should be asking ourselves: who unjustly profits from our convenience, and at whose expense?
