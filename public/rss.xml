     <description><![CDATA[<p>Ursula Franklin&#39;s <strong>&quot;The Real World of Technology&quot;</strong> (CBC Massey Lectures, 1989) could have been delivered today. It reads as a stark warning from the past, and one going largely unheeded. Her analysis of how prescriptive technologies erode human agency and restructure social relations around compliance anticipated everything from algorithmic management to surveillance capitalism. Her thought proves only more prescient with the dawn of LLM automation.</p>
<p>On <strong>Algorithmic addiction</strong> and <strong>Addictive Design</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What does it say about our society, when human needs for fellowship and warmth are met by devices that provide illusions to the users and profits to the suppliers? The reason I find this particular application of technology so upsetting is that as a response to loneliness, it seems to me deceitful and fraudulent. There are no shortcuts to the investment of time and care in friendship and human bonding, and it is fraudulent to pretend otherwise. <strong>When human loneliness becomes a source of income for others through devices</strong>, we’d better stop and think a bit about the place of human needs in the real world of technology.&quot; — <strong>Ursula Franklin</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On <strong>prescriptive technologies</strong> and <strong>compliance culture</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s real world of technology is characterized by <strong>the dominance of prescriptive technologies</strong>. Prescriptive technologies are not restricted to materials production. They are used in administrative and economic activities and in many aspects of governance, and on them rests the real world of technology in which we live. While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a <strong>culture of compliance</strong>, that we are ever more conditioned to <strong>accept orthodoxy as normal</strong>, and to accept that there is only one way of doing &#39;it&#39;.&quot; — <strong>Ursula Franklin</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Prescriptive technologies eliminate</strong> the occasions for decision-making and judgement in general and especially for the making of <strong>principled decisions</strong>. Any goal of the technology is incorporated a priori in the design and is not negotiable […] As methods of materials production, prescriptive technologies have brought into the real world of technology a wealth of important products that have raised living standards and increased well-being. At the same time they have created a <strong>culture of compliance</strong>. The acculturation to compliance and conformity has, in turn, accelerated the use of prescriptive technologies in administration, government, and social services. The same development has diminished resistance to the programming of people.&quot; — <strong>Ursula Franklin</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Social change will not come to us like an avalanche down the mountain. Social change will come through seeds growing in well prepared soil—and it is we, like the earthworms, who prepare the soil. We also seed thoughts and knowledge and concern. We realize there are no guarantees as to what will come up. Yet we do know that without the seeds and the prepared soil nothing will grow at all. I am convinced that we are indeed already in a period in which this movement from below is becoming more and more articulate, but what is needed is a lot more earthworming.&quot; — <strong>Ursula Franklin</strong></p>

     <title>Disconnecting From Big Tech</title>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>In January 2026, I made the resolution to ditch US-based <strong>Big Tech</strong> as much as possible. We are living through a time of intensifying geopolitical tension and accelerating consolidation of digital infrastructure into a small number of empire-scale corporations who have captured the internet. They surveil our activity, manipulate our behaviour, extract our content, and sell it back to us like bottled water — or, should I say, high fructose slop.</p>
<p>Most people don&#39;t care where their data lives. We just want what&#39;s cheap, familiar, and what works. The real costs of that convenience are never disclosed the moment we sign up. We have quietly normalized storing our digital fingerprints under legal systems we never agreed to, in jurisdictions where we have no standing. That normalization is worth resisting.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Every program in your computer that is adverse to your interest can be neutralized with a program that is beneficial to your interests. And that means, that when you create a program that is deliberately bad, you invite new market entrance to make one that&#39;s good.&quot; — <strong>Cory Doctorow</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>Infrastructure isn&#39;t neutral</strong>. The same data pipelines and AI systems powering our productivity tools are procured for <strong>surveillance, unlawful policing, and warfare</strong>. The small print doesn&#39;t mention that. And none of it is more ethical for being algorithmic. <strong>Small Tech</strong>, not anti-technology, is the framing here. Smaller, local alternatives that can actually be held accountable; not platforms that answer to no one.</p>
<p>For inspiration, I looked to Paris Marx&#39;s <a href="https://disconnect.blog/getting-off-us-tech-a-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Off US Tech</a>, Scott Galloway&#39;s <a href="https://www.resistandunsubscribe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resist and Unsubscribe</a>, and <a href="https://quitgpt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuitGPT</a>, but with a few different needs as a software developer focused open source tooling and the responsible use of AI, which, for better or worse, is now considered a professional baseline.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started where impact is highest and personal friction is lowest, while weighing cost, effort, and the convenience of consolidating under one provider where it makes sense.</p>

<p><em>&quot;But I have nothing to hide!&quot;</em></p>
<p>This argument hasn&#39;t aged well. It assumes the rules won&#39;t change, that platforms won&#39;t be sold, and the data won&#39;t be misused, especially against those less fortunate than us.</p>
<p><strong>Data Privacy</strong> isn&#39;t about secrecy; it&#39;s about who holds power over your information and what they can do with it. <strong>Digital Sovereignty</strong> extends that question to jurisdiction: not just who holds the power, but under what law, with what accountability, and at what cost to community and the environment. </p>
<p>For Canadians, there is a persistent gap between the privacy protections we assume we have and what is actually enforceable when a service runs on US infrastructure, regardless of where the physical servers actually sit. This isn&#39;t about national borders. It&#39;s about <strong>legibility and accountability</strong>.</p>
<p>Every time we sign up or sign in we should be asking ourselves: <strong>who unfairly profits from our convenience, and at whose expense?</strong></p>

<p>&quot;There is no situation that is morally more evil than the situation in which evil has been so fully integrated into the situation that the individual itself is spared from being evil […] The machines that populate our world have spared us from incurring guilt, just as they have relieved us from baking bread or from calculating statistics.&quot; — <strong>Güther Anders</strong>.</p>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m a <em><strong>Software Developer</strong></em> with over a decade experience in mobile and enterprise systems, from early discovery through production. I approach engineering as a <em><strong>craft</strong></em>, valuing human authorship, collaboration and responsible AI-assisted workflows over black-box automation and proprietary lock-in. <em><strong>Open source</strong></em>, <em><strong>inclusive design</strong></em>, <em><strong>data privacy</strong></em>, <em><strong>digital sovereignty</strong></em>, and <em><strong>sustainable architecture</strong></em> are the principles that guide that practice.</p>
<p>Informed by <em><strong>Critical Theory</strong></em> and <em><strong>Philosophy of Technology</strong></em>, my goal is to build digital experiences and tools grounded in critical —and constructive— thinking. Healthy skepticism, resisting convenience as justification for ethical compromise, and insisting on solutions that respect the diverse communities and ecologies that sustain us.</p>
<p><em><strong>Model collapse</strong></em> is what happens when AI systems train on AI-generated data: outputs converge, variance narrows, and the model consumes its own tail. Whether or not model collapse proves technically inevitable, as a metaphor for the social, algorithmic monocultures follow the same pattern, erasing the particularities, contradictions, and ambiguities that make lived existence meaningful. When systems exclude human authorship, they deny contingency, erase difference, and foreclose creativity — and with them, the possibility of technology that genuinely serves the many, not just the few. Keeping that authorship legible, accountable, and celebrated is not an empty romantic gesture; it is a technical and ethical necessity.</p>
<p>Technology that augments rather than displaces human agency and creativity is worth building.</p>
