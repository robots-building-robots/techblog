        <h1>Disconnecting From Big Tech</h1>
    </header>
    <p>In January 2026, I made the resolution to ditch US-based <strong>Big Tech</strong> as much as possible. We are living through a time of intensifying geopolitical tension and accelerating consolidation of digital infrastructure into a small number of empire-scale corporations who surveil our activity, mine our content, and sell it back to us like bottled water — or, should I say, high fructose slop.</p>
<p>Most people don&#39;t care where their data lives. We just want what&#39;s cheap, familiar, and what works. The real costs of that convenience are never disclosed the moment we sign up. We have quietly normalized storing our digital fingerprints under legal systems we never agreed to, in jurisdictions where we have no standing. That normalization is worth resisting.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure isn&#39;t neutral</strong>. The same data pipelines and AI systems powering our productivity tools are procured for <strong>surveillance, unlawful policing, and warfare</strong>. The small print doesn&#39;t mention that. And none of it is more ethical for being algorithmic. <strong>Small Tech</strong>, not anti-technology, is the framing here. Smaller, local alternatives that can actually be held accountable; not platforms that answer to no one.</p>
<p>For inspiration, I looked to Paris Marx&#39;s <a href="https://disconnect.blog/getting-off-us-tech-a-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Off US Tech</a>, Scott Galloway&#39;s <a href="https://www.resistandunsubscribe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resist and Unsubscribe</a>, and <a href="https://quitgpt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuitGPT</a>, but with a few different needs as a software developer focused open source tooling and the responsible use of AI, which, for better or worse, is now considered a professional baseline.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started where impact is highest and personal friction is lowest, while weighing cost, effort, and the convenience of consolidating under one provider where it makes sense.</p>

<p>&quot;But I have nothing to hide!&quot; </p>
<p>This argument hasn&#39;t aged well. It assumes the rules won&#39;t change, that platforms won&#39;t be sold, and the data won&#39;t be misused. </p>
<p><strong>Data Privacy</strong> isn&#39;t about secrecy; it&#39;s about who holds power over your information and what they can do with it. <strong>Digital Sovereignty</strong> extends that question to jurisdiction: not just who holds the power, but under what law, with what accountability, and at what cost to community and the environment. </p>
<p>For Canadians, there is a persistent gap between the privacy protections we assume we have and what is actually enforceable when a service runs on US infrastructure, regardless of where the physical servers actually sit. This isn&#39;t about national borders. It&#39;s about <strong>legibility and accountability</strong>.</p>
<p>Every time we sign up or sign in we should be asking ourselves: <strong>who unfairly profits from our convenience, and at whose expense?</strong></p>
