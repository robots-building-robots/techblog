        <h1>Ditching Big Tech</h1>
    </header>
<p>In January 2026, I made the resolution to ditch US-based <em><strong>Big Tech</strong></em> as much as practically possible. We are living through intensifying geopolitical tension and accelerating consolidation of digital infrastructure into the hands of a small number of empire-sized corporations who surveil our activity, mine our content, and sell it back to us like bottled water — or more like high fructose slop. </p>
<p>Most people don&#39;t care where their data lives, they choose what&#39;s cheap, familiar, and what works. The real costs of that convenience are never disclosed at the moment of choice. We have quietly normalized storing our digital lives under legal systems we never agreed to, in jurisdictions where we have no standing. That normalization is worth resisting.</p>
<p>For inspiration, I looked to some of the many movements like <a href="https://quitgpt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuitGPT</a>, Scott Galloway&#39;s <a href="https://www.resistandunsubscribe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resist and Unsubscribe</a>, and Paris Marx&#39;s <a href="https://disconnect.blog/getting-off-us-tech-a-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Off US Tech</a>, but with a few different needs as a software developer focused on infrastructure, open source tooling,and the responsible use of AI — which, for better or worse, is now considered a professional baseline.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t about national borders. It&#39;s about legibility — being able to answer who controls your data, under what law, with what accountability, and at what cost to community and the environment. For Canadians, there is a persistent gap between the privacy protections we assume we have and what is actually enforceable when a service runs on US infrastructure, regardless of where the physical servers actually sit.</p>
<p><strong>Small Tech</strong>, not anti-technology, is the framing here. Technology taken seriously enough to ask: who unjustly profits from our convenience, and at whose expense?</p>

<h2 id="sovereignty-stack">Sovereignty Stack</h2>
<h3 id="infrastructure--identity">Infrastructure &amp; Identity</h3>
<p><em><strong>OS, Browser, Email, DNS:</strong></em> The base layer everything else flows through. Get this wrong and nothing above it matters. Hardest to change, highest stakes.</p>
<h3 id="professional-data">Professional Data</h3>
<p><em><strong>Code repositories, CI/CD, Cloud Documents, Web hosting, LLMs:</strong></em> Where the work lives: source code, client data, intellectual property, and the AI tools now inside the creative process. Stakes are professional and legal. Moderately difficult to migrate.</p>
<h3 id="communications--collaboration">Communications &amp; Collaboration</h3>
<p><em><strong>Messaging, Team Communications, Video calls, Calendar, Contacts:</strong></em> High-frequency and often sensitive, but the risk is metadata and surveillance rather than long-term data custody. Easier to change.</p>
<h3 id="convenience--consumption">Convenience &amp; Consumption</h3>
<p><em><strong>Maps, Media streaming, Social Media, Search:</strong></em> In some cases the highest friction to replace, but lowest sovereignty stakes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started where the cost and effort-to-impact ratio makes the most sense. Changing an email provider is manageable; replacing your OS without your daily workload grinding to a halt is a long-term goal for me. What follows is an ongoing log of where I started, where I&#39;m moving, and why. </p>

<p>&quot;There is no situation that is morally more evil than the situation in which evil has been so fully integrated into the situation that the individual itself is spared from being evil […] The machines that populate our world have spared us from incurring guilt, just as they have relieved us from baking bread or from calculating statistics.&quot; — <em><strong>Güther Anders</strong></em>.</p>
