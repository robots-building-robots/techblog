        <p>&quot;Today&#39;s real world of technology is characterized by <strong>the dominance of prescriptive technologies</strong>. Prescriptive technologies are not restricted to materials production. They are used in administrative and economic activities and in many aspects of governance, and on them rests the real world of technology in which we live. While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a <strong>culture of compliance</strong>, that we are ever more conditioned to <strong>accept orthodoxy as normal</strong>, and to accept that there is only one way of doing &#39;it&#39;.&quot; — <strong>Ursula Franklin</strong> [&hellip;]</p>

        <p>In January 2026, I made the resolution to ditch US-based <strong>Big Tech</strong> as much as possible. We are living through a time of intensifying geopolitical tension and accelerating consolidation of digital infrastructure into a small number of empire-scale corporations who have captured the internet. They surveil our activity, manipulate our behaviour, extract our content, and sell it back to us like bottled water — or, should I say, high fructose slop. [&hellip;]</p>

        <p>I&#39;m a <em><strong>Software Developer</strong></em> with over a decade experience in mobile and enterprise systems, from early discovery through production. I approach engineering as a <em><strong>craft</strong></em>, valuing human authorship, collaboration and responsible AI-assisted workflows over black-box automation, platform dependency, and proprietary lock-in. <em><strong>Open source</strong></em>, <em><strong>inclusive design</strong></em>, <em><strong>data privacy</strong></em>, <em><strong>digital sovereignty</strong></em>, and <em><strong>sustainable architecture</strong></em> are the principles that guide that practice.
